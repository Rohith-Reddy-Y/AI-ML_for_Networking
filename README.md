## Project Description
This project implements an AI-driven solution for detecting SQL Injection (SQLi) and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks in network traffic using machine learning. It features a web interface for real-time threat detection, file upload analysis (CSV, PDF, DOCX, TXT), and detailed logging. The system uses pre-trained models (RandomForestClassifier, Doc2Vec) and integrates a Web Application Firewall (WAF) concept for enhanced security.

## Problem Statement

Description:  
Develop a machine learning-based solution to detect and prevent common web application attacks such as SQL Injection and XSS, with an easy-to-use web interface for real-time detection and file analysis.

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**  
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Rohith-Reddy-Y/AI-ML_for_Networking.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**  
   ```
   cd AI-ML_for_Networking
   ```

3. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**  
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```
   On Windows:
   ```
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Install dependencies:**  
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Create a `.env` file in the `Attacks_Detection` directory (optional):**  
   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
   HF_API_TOKEN=your_hf_api_token
   ```

## Training the Models

### SQL Injection Model:

1. Navigate to the `ML-SQL-Injection` directory:
   ```
   cd ML-SQL-Injection
   ```

2. Run the Good_and_Bad_requests.py to generate the dataset:
   ```
   python Good_and_Bad_requests.py
   ```
   ➔ This processes `bad_requests.log` and `good_requests.log` to create `Good_and_Bad_requests_1.csv`.

3. Train the RandomForestClassifier model:
   ```
   python Train_SQLi_model.py
   ```
   ➔ This saves the model to `ML-SQL-Injection/SQLi_Model.pkl`.

---

### XSS Model:

1. Navigate to the `ML-XSS` directory:
   ```
   cd ML-XSS
   ```

2. **Run the training script in Jupyter Notebook:**  
   Make sure you have Jupyter installed:
   ```
   pip install notebook
   ```
   Then launch the notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook XSS-Doc2Vec-ML-Classifier-checkpoint.ipynb
   ```
   ➔ This will open the notebook in your browser.  
   ➔ Run all the cells to train the model.

   This generates:
   - `ML-XSS/lib/d2v.model`
   - `ML-XSS/lib/RandomForestClassifier.sav` *(best accuracy)*
   - Other `.sav` models.

---

## Running the Application

⚠️ **Important:** Make sure to copy the following trained files into the `Attacks_Detection/Models` folder before running:
- `d2v.model`
- `RandomForestClassifier.sav`
- `SQLi_Model.pkl`

1. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
   On Windows:
   ```
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. Navigate to the `Attacks_Detection` directory:
   ```
   cd Attacks_Detection
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

4. Access the web interface at:  
   [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

---

## Web Interface Features:

- Enter a query for real-time SQLi/XSS detection.
- Upload a file (`CSV`, `PDF`, `DOCX`, `TXT`) for batch analysis.
